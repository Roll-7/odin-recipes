        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A grilled steak is a thick, juicy cut of beef cooked over an open flame 
            or hot grill to develop a flavorful seared crust while<br> keeping the inside 
            tender and cooked to your preferred doneness. Often seasoned simply with 
            salt and pepper, steak can be<br> enjoyed on its own or paired with sauces, 
            sides, or vegetables for a hearty, protein-rich meal.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Steak (ribeye, sirloin, strip, or filet)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Garlic (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh rosemary or thyme (optional)</li>
            <li>Butter (optional, for finishing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Your Cut: Select a steak cut like ribeye, sirloin, NY strip, or filet mignon</li>
            <li>Bring to Room Temperature: Let the steak sit out for 20–30 minutes before grilling.</li>
            <li>Season the Steak: Generously season both sides with salt and black pepper (or your preferred seasoning).</li>
            <li>Preheat the Grill: Heat your grill to high (around 450–500°F) and clean the grates.</li>
            <li>Oil the Grates: Lightly oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Grill the Steak: Place the steak on the grill and cook for 3–5 minutes per side depending on thickness and desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Check Doneness: Use a meat thermometer (e.g., 130°F for medium-rare) or the finger test for doneness.</li>
            <li>Rest the Steak: Remove from heat and let rest for 5–10 minutes to retain juices.</li>
            <li>Slice (if needed): Cut against the grain if slicing before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve: Plate the steak and enjoy with your favorite sides or sauce.</li>
