        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Form the Patties: Divide 1 pound of ground beef (80/20 lean-to-fat ratio) into 4 equal portions and gently shape into round patties, about ¾ inch thick.
                <li>Season the Patties: Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper just before cooking.
                <li>Preheat Your Cooking Surface: Heat a skillet, grill, or griddle over medium-high heat until hot.
                <li>Cook the Patties: Place patties on the hot surface and cook 3–4 minutes per side (or to desired doneness), flipping once.
                <li>Add Cheese (Optional): Place a slice of cheese on each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover to melt.
                <li>Toast the Buns: Lightly butter the insides of the hamburger buns and toast them on the skillet or grill until golden.
                <li>Assemble the Burger: Place the cooked patty on the bottom bun, then layer with desired toppings (e.g., lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles).
                <li>Add Condiments: Spread ketchup, mustard, mayo, or other sauces on the top bun.
                <li>Top and Serve: Close the burger with the top bun.
                <li>Enjoy: Serve hot with fries, chips, or a side of your choice.
