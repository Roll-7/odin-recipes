        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Shrimp scampi is a beloved Italian-American dish that perfectly 
            marries the delicate sweetness of shrimp with the bold<br> flavors of 
            garlic, white wine, and butter. This elegant yet simple preparation 
            transforms humble ingredients into a<br> restaurant-quality meal that 
            can be prepared in under 20 minutes. The dish gets its name from the 
            Italian word "scampo,"<br> which refers to a type of lobster, though the 
            American version has evolved to feature shrimp as the star. 
            Traditionally served<br> over pasta or with crusty bread, shrimp scampi 
            offers a perfect balance of richness from the butter, brightness 
            from lemon<br> juice, and aromatic depth from fresh garlic and herbs.
